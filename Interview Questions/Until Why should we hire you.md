My resume demonstrates that I’ve been successful with the key responsibilities of this role: managing teams, developing strategic sales plans, and delivering quarterly targets. I’ve been managing teams for the last 10 years and to this day, many of my former direct reports still call and ask for career or personal advice. I’ve also led the development of strategic plans with the customer for years. I first listen and understand their priorities and objectives, then develop a win-win solution for both parties. Last year my team received 2 awards. The first was from our internal organization for collaboration and partnership in developing our 3-year plans. The second was the Vendor of The Year Award from the customer for putting together plans that exceeded their growth targets. I’ve been in sales for the last 15 years and I know how important it is to hit targets — it’s the lifeblood of what we do. That’s why I work hard to support and guide my team, as well as work with internal partners to anticipate and remove roadblocks. I believe I would be a great fit for this role as I already have relevant experience and been successful in my previous roles. Why this answer worked well:The answer detailed deep industry knowledge and a record of success across several themes.The focus on teams painted a picture of an invested leader who sees success as collective.
