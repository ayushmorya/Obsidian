I have a strong desire to succeed, which generally serves me well. But I’ve realized that it can also be a blind spot if I’m not being honest with myself about what’s possible. A few years ago, I was working on a remote control, and the schedule was very tight. We were trying to go from concept to mass production in six months, and there was a high amount of pressure. I made the decision to continue with the factory build, even though my team was concerned that one of the parts we were using would fail. Because we had already spent $200,000 on the factory process, I pushed ahead. I was afraid to tell the program managers that we wouldn’t be able to hit our targets. Eventually, I was forced to — but I had already lost the company money. What I learned from this is the importance of being honest right up front and being realistic, even if it’s not the outcome I want. I’ve learned that failures can be turned around more easily when addressed quickly. Now I communicate status with program managers on a weekly basis. I always make them aware of the risks and what the impact might be. In the past four years, we haven't missed a single delivery. Why this answer worked well: The answer provided an honest self-review with a clear example that took the interviewer through the decision-making process. The candidate took accountability and specific steps to prevent another issue.
