- **Start Small**: Take on low-risk projects to build confidence and reputation.
- **Be Transparent**: Tell clients you’re new but eager to deliver value at a fair price.
- **Upskill Continuously**: Dedicate 1–2 hours daily to learning (e.g., via free courses).
- **Focus on Client Needs**: Solve their pain points (e.g., slow deployments, high costs) rather than pushing complex solutions.

By following this roadmap, you can go from beginner to pro in 6–12 months, depending on your pace. Start with easy services, leverage free AI tools, and gradually scale your offerings as you gain experience. Good luck building your cloud and DevOps brand!
